- 👋 Yo Fams, I’m Muhammad Usman aka @usmanazam74
- 👀 I’m an ELectrical Engineer and I have decided to join Github to start forming a digital footprint or rather a programing portfolio of mine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IoT (Internet of Things) using ESP32, Arduino and similar boards. I have also worked with such boards including
- TIVA Arm Cortex and Arduino for several small projects and now I want to get back into the coding practice.
